# BizCardX-Extracting Business Card Data by using easyOCR 

## Introduction

* In today's fast-paced business environment, efficiently managing and organizing contact information is crucial for successful networking and communication. With the advent of digital tools and technologies, manual entry of business card details into a database can be time-consuming and prone to errors. To overcome these challenges, developers can leverage the power of optical character recognition (OCR) and databases to automate the process of extracting relevant information from business cards and storing it for easy access.

* One powerful OCR library that facilitates the extraction of text from images is EasyOCR. EasyOCR is an open-source Python library that utilizes deep learning models to accurately recognize and extract text from various languages. By integrating EasyOCR with a MySQL database, developers can streamline the process of capturing business card data and storing it in a structured and organized manner.
